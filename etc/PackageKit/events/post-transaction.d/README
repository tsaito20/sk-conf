README

Executable scripts can be installed in this directory and will be run
before or after each transaction. The transaction type will be the first
parameter to the script, e.g. "search-name" or "refresh-cache".

*** THESE SCRIPTS ARE RUN AS ROOT AND ARE SECURITY SENSITIVE ***

Be sure to ensure that files here have the correct permissions
(owned by root, and not writable by users), or they will not be run by
the daemon.
