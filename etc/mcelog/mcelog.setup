# An upstream kernel bug prevents mcelog from starting normally in
# daemon mode the first time it is run. So, in the systemd service,
# we want to start it twice - one as a ExecStartPre that will fail.
# But systemd will abort the process if the "pre" fails, so we use
# this script - temporarily - to start the first process.
#
# Waiting on Andi Kleen to fix upstream.
